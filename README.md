# Generative-AI
A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) consists of two neural networks, the **generator** and the **discriminator**, which are trained simultaneously through a competitive process.

1. Generator => Its goal is to create data that is indistinguishable from real data.
2. Discriminator => The discriminator network tries to distinguish between real data and data generated by the generator. It is trained on both real data and the fake data generated by the generator.
