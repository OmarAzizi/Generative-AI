# Generative-AI
A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a type of artificial intelligence framework. It consists of two neural networks, the **generator** and the **discriminator**, which are trained simultaneously through a competitive process.

1. Generator: The generator network generates synthetic data, such as images, sound, or text, from random noise or other input data. Its goal is to create data that is indistinguishable from real data.
2. Discriminator: The discriminator network tries to distinguish between real data and data generated by the generator. It is trained on both real data and the fake data generated by the generator. Its objective is to correctly classify the source of the data as real or fake.
