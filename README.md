# Generative-AI
A [Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network) consists of two neural networks, the **generator** and the **discriminator**, which are trained simultaneously through a competitive process.

1. Generator: Its goal is to create data that is indistinguishable from real data.
2. Discriminator: The discriminator network tries to distinguish between real data and data generated by the generator. It is trained on both real data and the fake data generated by the generator.

## About This Project
I used the [MNIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) dataset to train the GAN for generating hand-written digits. Then I used [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) to plot some generated images on each epoch.

### Before Training
The images generated were basically just noise
