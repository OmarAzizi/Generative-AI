# Generative-AI
[Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network) consists of two neural networks, the **generator** and the **discriminator**, which are trained simultaneously through a competitive process.

1. Generator: Its goal is to create data that is indistinguishable from real data.
2. Discriminator: The discriminator network tries to distinguish between real data and data generated by the generator. It is trained on both real data and the fake data generated by the generator.


## About This Model
I used the [MNIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) dataset to train the GAN for generating hand-written digits. Then I used [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) to plot some generated images on each epoch.
```bash
  | Name          | Type          | Parameters 
------------------------------------------------
0 | generator     | Generator     | 358 K 
1 | discriminator | Discriminator | 21.4 K
------------------------------------------------
```


### Before Training
The images generated were basically just noise

### After First Epoch

### After 10 Epochs
Generated images pattern started to look like a hand-written digit

### After 100 Epochs
Generated images now look like hand-written digits now
